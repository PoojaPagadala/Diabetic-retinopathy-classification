# Diabetic-retinopathy-classification
Combined ResNet50 and InceptionV3 CNN model for image classification

This project presents an automated deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using retinal images. The system leverages a hybrid CNN model combining ResNet50 and InceptionV3 architectures, trained on the APTOS 2019 dataset. The model is deployed via a web application using Flask, enabling easy use by healthcare providers or patients.
