          <p class="d">
            There are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut, can also help your eyes.</li>
            <li>Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma.</li>
            <li>Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.</li>
            <li>Wear protective eyewear. To prevent eye injuries, you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home.</li>
            <li>Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve.</li>
            <li>Know your family medical history. Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.</li>
            <li>Know your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know your risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.</li>
            <li>If you wear contact lenses, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also, follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed.</li>
            <li>Give your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.</li>
          </ul>
